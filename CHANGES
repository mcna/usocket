0.5.0:

* New supported platform: Macintosh Common Lisp (5.0 and up, plus RMCL)
* Support for UDP (datagram-usocket) was added (for all supported platform except MCL)
* Add WAIT-FOR-INPUT support for SBCL and ECL on win32.
* Simple TCP and UDP server API: SOCKET-SERVER
* Lots of bug fixed since 0.4.1

0.5.1:

* Bugfix: Fixed wrong macro expansions of {IP|PORT}-{FROM|TO}-OCTET-BUFFER functions!
* Bugfix: SOCKET-CONNECT didn't set CONNECTED-P for datagram usockets on most backends.
* Bugfix: [SBCL] Fixes for "SBCL/Win32: finalizer problem, etc", by Anton Kovalenko <anton@sw4me.com>
* Bugfix: [SBCL] Fixed SOCKET-SERVER (UDP) on SBCL due to a issue in SOCKET-CONNECT when HOST is NIL.
* Bugfix: [SBCL] SOCKET-CONNECT's TIMEOUT argument now works as a "connection timeout".
* Bugfix: [CMUCL] Fixed SOCKET-SEND on unconnected usockets under Unicode version of CMUCL.
* Bugfix: [LispWorks] Better network error type detection on LispWorks.
* Bugfix: [CLISP] Fixed UDP (Datagram) support (RAWSOCK version), confirmed by CL-NET-SNMP.
* Enhancement: SOCKET-SERVER return a second value (socket) when calling in new-thread mode.
* Enhancement: [CLISP] Full support of DNS helper functions (GET-HOST-BY-NAME, ...) added.

[TODO]

* New feature: CLISP support UDP without RAWSOCK (using FFI interface)
* New feature: CLISP support some advanced TCP features which CLISP's SOCKET interface not provide
* New feature: Macintosh Common Lisp (MCL) support Datagram sockets (UDP)
