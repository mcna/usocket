$Id$


This is the usocket Common Lisp sockets library: a library to bring
sockets access to the broadest of common lisp implementations as possible.


The library currently supports:

 - SBCL
 - CMUCL
 - ArmedBear
 - clisp
 - Allegro
 - LispWorks
 - OpenMCL
 - <Your favorite Common Lisp here?>

If your favorite common lisp misses in the list above, please contact
usocket-devel@common-lisp.net and submit a request.  Please include
references to available sockets functions in your lisp implementation.

The library has been ASDF (http://cliki.net/ASDF) enabled, meaning
that you can tar up a checkout and use that to ASDF-INSTALL:INSTALL
the package in your system package site.  (Or use your usual ASDF
tricks to use the checkout directly.)


usocket interface:

 - usocket (class)
 - socket-connect (function) [ to create an active/connected socket ]
    socket-connect host port
      where `host' is a vectorized ip
                      or a string representation of a dotted ip address
                      or a hostname for lookup in the DNS system
 - socket-close (method)
    socket-close socket
      where socket a previously returned socket
 - socket-stream (usocket slot accessor),
    socket-stream socket
      the return value of which satisfies the normal stream interface


Errors:
 - address-in-use-error
 - address-not-available-error
 - bad-file-descriptor-error
 - connection-refused-error
 - connection-aborted-error
 - connection-reset-error
 - invalid-argument-error
 - no-buffers-error
 - operation-not-supported-error
 - operation-not-permitted-error
 - protocol-not-supported-error
 - socket-type-not-supported-error
 - network-unreachable-error
 - network-down-error
 - network-reset-error
 - host-down-error
 - host-unreachable-error
 - shutdown-error
 - timeout-error
 - unkown-error

Non-fatal conditions:
 - interrupted-condition
 - unkown-condition




KNOWN PROBLEMS
- CMUCL error reporting wrt sockets raises only simple-errors
  meaning there's no way to tell different error conditions apart.
  All errors are mapped to unknown-error on CMUCL.

- When running the test suite through the run-usocket-tests.sh shell
  script, ArmedBear 0.0.9 will report failure - even when it didn't.
  You need a CVS version later than 2006-02-11, or later than 0.0.9
  for the script to work correctly.
