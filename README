usocket interface:

 - usocket (class)
 - socket-connect (function) [ to create an active/connected socket ]
    socket-connect host port
      where `host' is a vectorized ip
                      or a string representation of a dotted ip address
                      or a hostname for lookup in the DNS system
 - socket-close (method)
    socket-close socket
      where socket a previously returned socket
 - socket-stream (usocket slot accessor),
    socket-stream socket
      the return value of which satisfies the normal stream interface

KNOWN PROBLEMS
- CMUCL error reporting wrt sockets raises only simple-errors
  meaning there's no way to tell different error conditions apart.
  All errors are mapped to unknown-error on CMUCL.
