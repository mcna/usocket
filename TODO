- Check consistency of error translation for each of the backends
  with the design document.

- check stream creation arguments such as element-type and external-format
  for availability in the different lisps.

- Move all function documentation from the backends to
  (setf documentation) forms in usocket.lisp.

- Extend ABCL socket support with the 4 java errors in java.net.*
  so that they can map to our usocket errors instead of mapping
  all errors to unknown-error.

- Investigate which backends would support streams with other
  elements than :element-type 'character, especially since
  cl-irc chokes on characters which are non-UTF8 conforming...
  Probably other clients do too (try that with a binary HTTP stream!)

- change CMUCL implementation to catch name resolution errors:
  Don't send host names into connect-to-inet-socket, but use
  gethostbyname, binding the return value and the error code.
  Raise an error if gethostbyname returns one.
