                  usocket: Universal sockets library
                  ==================================

Contents
========



Design goal
===========

To provide a portable socket interface for as many implementations as
possible, while keeping the portability layer as thin as possible.

Minimally, I'd like to support:
 - SBCL
 - CMUCL
 - Allegro
 - LispWorks
 - ArmedBear (ABCL)
